    Background:
        Given the store operates on a single green channel in "United States"
        And the store has "VAT" tax rate of 23% for "Shipping Services" within the "US" zone
        And the store has a product "Mr. Meeseeks T-Shirt" priced at "$10.00"
        And the store has "Galaxy Post" shipping method with "$20.00" fee
        And the store has "Space Pidgeons Post" shipping method with "$10.00" fee within the "US" zone
        And shipping method "Space Pidgeons Post" belongs to "Shipping Services" tax category
        And the store allows paying with "Space money"
        And there is a customer "rick.sanchez@wubba-lubba-dub-dub.com" that placed an order "#00000022"
